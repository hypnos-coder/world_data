# Neural network from scratch (no external libs)

This repository contains code that build a NN from scratch with all the math behind it.
An XOR operation and a house price prediction was used to test the model. the model is class based and was written so that it can be extendable. Hence, any type of optimization algorithm can be implemented later.
