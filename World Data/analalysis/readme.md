## the data is cleaned but not cleaned to the point that we can uploat it to bit.io
## As promised, I did it in python. Each folder holds 3 files: 
    -the notebook containing the code, 
    -the data profiling(I will explain that when we meet). It is the html file
    -the cleaned data
## You migh wanna run the notebook but there are bunch of additional libraries required(I will explain that when we meet)
## Unfortunately, I did not comment the code so it would be hard to understand.
## Depending on the business questions tyanna comes up with, we might need to do more stuff, but I promise nothing crazy :)

## Thank you for taking the time to explore the readme.
## Also, long life to python, the language used by god to build the world üññüèæ
## for the cleaning process, the method used are prety much the same thing with modified details for special cases
